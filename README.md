## Task-2:PARKINSONS DISEASE CLASSIFICATION

#### This dataset consists of 195 records which includes biomedical voice mesurements of 31 people

#### we need to predict the person is healthy or affected by the parkinson's disease based on these voice measurements

#### I used various algorithms to predict the whether the person affected by disease or not 

#### Algorithms used:LogisticRegression,SupportVectorMachine,RandomForest,XGBOOST


## Task-4:MNIST DIGIT CLASSIFICATION

#### This dataset consists of records which are having 784 pixel values as their attributes

#### we need to predict the digit , by processing 784 pixel values as attributes to our model

#### algorithms used : XGBOOST
